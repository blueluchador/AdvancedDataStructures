## Lookups

The `Lookups` module contains data structures designed for fast and efficient data retrieval. These structures are optimized for scenarios where quick access to information is critical, whether you're working with strings, objects, or massive datasets.

### Tries

Tries are tree-based data structures that organize strings by splitting them into individual characters. Each path through the tree represents a string, and shared prefixes reduce redundancy, making Tries especially efficient for prefix-based operations.

**When to Use:**
- **Autocomplete:** Suggest words or phrases as users type in search bars or text fields.  
- **Spell Check and Auto-Correction:** Validate or correct user input by quickly finding valid words or close matches.  
- **IP Address Management:** Efficiently store and retrieve IP address prefixes in networking applications.  
- **Tagging and Categorization Systems:** Manage hierarchical tags or categories, such as in content management systems.  
- **Data Compression:** Optimize storage and retrieval of repetitive datasets like URLs, file paths, or dictionary words.

**Pros:**
- Efficient for prefix searches and lookups.  
- Compact representation for data with shared prefixes.  
- Can handle large datasets of strings with overlapping content.

**Cons:**
- Can use significant memory for large alphabets (e.g., Unicode).  
- Less efficient for storing sparse data with no shared prefixes.  
- Updates (insertions or deletions) can be slower than simpler structures like hash maps.

### Skip Lists

Skip Lists are an advanced version of linked lists, adding multiple layers of shortcuts that allow for faster search, insert, and delete operations. They balance themselves probabilistically without the need for complex algorithms.

**When to Use:**
- **In-Memory Caching:** Store and retrieve frequently accessed data with fast updates.  
- **Database Indexing:** Support sorted operations like range queries, offering a simpler alternative to trees.  
- **Real-Time Rankings:** Maintain leaderboards or rankings in systems like online games or fitness apps.  
- **Priority Queues:** Dynamically manage tasks or events based on priority levels.  
- **Search Engines:** Store indexed terms or document frequencies that need frequent updates.  
- **Analytics Processing:** Quickly aggregate or search through metrics data.

**Variations:**
1. **Standard Skip List**  
   - **When to Use:** For simple datasets (e.g., integers, strings) under 100,000 records.  
   - **Example:** Retrieving user session data quickly.

2. **Comparable Skip List**  
   - **When to Use:** For datasets with complex objects requiring custom comparison logic.  
   - **Example:** Searching through a product catalog by custom attributes like price or rating.

3. **Sharded Skip List**  
   - **When to Use:** For large datasets (over 100,000 records) to improve performance during bulk operations.  
   - **Example:** Managing analytics logs for web traffic data.

4. **Sharded Comparable Skip List**  
   - **When to Use:** For large, complex datasets requiring both custom comparisons and scalability.  
   - **Example:** Handling inventory for an e-commerce platform with attributes like stock, price, and popularity.

**Pros:**
- Faster than linked lists for search, insert, and delete operations.  
- Easier to implement than balanced trees (no rotations or rebalancing).  
- Sharded versions scale well for very large datasets.  

**Cons:**
- Requires more memory than simple linked lists due to additional layers.  
- Probabilistic balancing means worst-case performance isnâ€™t guaranteed.  
- Not as compact as hash maps for storing sparse datasets.
