# Advanced Data Structures

Advanced data structures are essential for tackling complex computational challenges that go beyond the capabilities of basic structures like arrays or linked lists. They are designed to handle specific problems efficiently, such as fast prefix matching with Tries, spatial data organization with QuadTrees, or optimized priority queues with Fibonacci Heaps.  

In modern software development, these structures play a critical role in areas like big data processing, machine learning, and efficient database operations. By incorporating these advanced tools into development workflows, developers can achieve greater performance, solve specialized problems effectively, and build more scalable, responsive applications.

This repository is structured into categories based on the types of data structures, such as **Trees**, **Lookup Structures**, **Range Query Structures**, **Graphs**, and others. Some categories may contain subcategories to organize related structures further. Each project includes documentation detailing the purpose, use cases, and implementation of the data structures, offering a clear and organized way to explore and utilize them.
